1.  Introduction

   The IETF has specified YANG modules for energy efficiency Management,
   e.g., Energy Saving Network models
   [I-D.cwbgp-green-energy-saving-management], Power Management Device
   Model [I-D.li-green-power].  Other relevant YANG data models are
   Network topologies Base Model [RFC8345] and Network Inventory Base
   Model [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].  There are common data
   nodes and structures that are present in all of these models or at
   least a subset of them.

   This document defines a common YANG module for energy efficiency
   metrics and energy efficiency capabilities that is meant to be reused
   by various energy efficiency-related modules such as energy saving
   Network models, energy saving network inventory model and energy
   saving device models.

   The "ietf-energy-efficiency-common" module includes a set of
   identities, types, and groupings for energy efficiency metrics and
   energy efficiency capabilities that are meant to be reused by other
   energy efficiency-related YANG modules independently of their
   characteristics (e.g., variable, invariable) and the type of the
   module (e.g., network model, device model), including possible future
   revisions of existing models (e.g., the Network Topology [RFC8345] or
   the Network Inventory [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang]).

2.  Conventions and Definitions


   The terminology for describing YANG modules is defined in [RFC7950].
   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   The reader may refer to [I-D.bclp-green-terminology] for energy
   efficiency-related terms.

   This document inherits many terms from [RFC7326] (e.g., energy,
   power, energy management, energy monitoring).

3.  Description of the Energy Efficiency Common YANG Module

   The "ietf-energy-efficiency-common" module defines the following
   feature:

   *  "energy-saving": Indicates support of energy efficiency network
      management.

   It also defines a set of identities, including the following:

   *  "energy-saving-mode": Specifies the energy saving mode.  Examples
      of supported energy saving modes are as follows:

      -  "basic": The system will shut down idle modules and put them in
         a sleep power state.

      -  "standard": The system extends basic energy saving mode with
         more advanced lossless energy saving features, e.g., power
         module schedule.

      -  "deep": The system extends standard energy saving mode with
         more advanced system level energy saving features, e.g., board
         scheduling.

   *  "energy-saving-power-state": Specifies the energy saving power
      state.  Examples of supported energy saving power state are as
      follows:

      -  "off-state": The component typically requires a complete boot
         when awakened.

      -  "sleep-state": The component with energy management support is
         not functional but immediately available such as wake up
         mechanism.

      -  "low-power-state": Some components with energy management
         support are not available and these components can take
         measures to use less energy.

      -  "full-power-state": All components with energy management
         support are available and may use maximum power.

   *  "energy-saving-method": Specifies the energy saving method.
      Examples of supported energy saving methods are as follows:

      -  "zone-based-fan-speed-adjustment": The system collects
         information about the temperatures of the service boards in the
         chassis and the zones where the service boards reside.
         According to the current temperature and target temperature of
         each board, the system implements stepless speed adjustment in
         different zones.

      -  "unused-high-speed-interface-shutdown": When detecting an
         unused high-speed interface, the system shuts down the
         interface to reduce power consumption of the interface
         circuits.  When the interface needs to run service, the system
         will automatically wake up the interface and restore the
         interface to the normal working state.

      -  "unused-port-shutdown": When detecting an unused user port, the
         system automatically or manually shuts down the interface
         circuits and optical module of the port to reduce port power
         consumption.  When detecting that the port needs to run
         service, the system automatically enables the port and restores
         the port to the normal running state, without affecting
         application of the board.

      -  "unused-board-shutdown": When detecting an unused board, the
         system automatically shuts down the power supply of the board,
         ensuring zero power consumption of an unused board.  When
         detecting that the board needs to run service, the system
         automatically powers on the board and restores the board to the
         normalrunning state, without affecting application of the whole
         device.

      -  "dynamic-frequency-adjustment": When detecting that a service
         board is carrying a small service load, the system
         automatically reduces the working frequency of the service
         processing module of the board while maintaining the service
         quality.  In doing so, power consumption of the service
         processing module is reduced.  When the service load of the
         board increases, the system automatically increases the working
         frequency of the service processing module to meet service
         needs.

      -  "unused-channel-shutdown": When an unused channel is detected,
         the unused channel is closed.  Dynamically open the channel
         when detecting that there are services on the channel.

      -  "load-based-power-module-scheduling": Power modules
         intelligently schedule internal power supply based on the power
         load.  When the power load decreases, some power supplies are
         automatically disabled.  When the power load increases, the
         disabled power supplies are enabled again.

      -  "load-based-board-scheduling": Boards intelligently schedule
         internal forwarding resources based on the service load.  When
         the service load decreases, some forwarding resources are
         automatically disabled or the working frequency of the
         forwarding resources is reduced.  When the service load
         increases, the disabled forwarding resources are enabled again
         or the working frequency of forwarding resources is improved.
         In the case of burst traffic, packet forwarding may be delayed,
         but packets will not be lost.

   In addition, it defines the following types:

   *  "energy-saving-operator": Indicates the type of energy saving
      operator.  Either a power-on or a power-off is allowed to be
      specified.

   The "ietf-energy-efficiency-common" module also contains a set of
   resuable energy efficiency-related groupings.  Figure 1 provides the
   tree diagram that depicts the common groupings for the "ietf-energy-
   efficiency-common" module.

5.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-energy-efficiency-common" YANG module defines a data model
   that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols,
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols
   have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS
   [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG module defines a set of identities, types, and groupings.
   These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG modules.  The
   module by itself does not expose any data nodes that are writable,
   data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As such, there are
   no additional security issues related to the YANG module that need to
   be considered.

   Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

Acknowledgments

   This work has benefited from the discussions that occurred during the
   Sustainable Networking Side Meeting in IETF#117 and the "e-impact"
   IAB workshop.  In particular, [I-D.cx-green-green-metrics] assess
   several sustainability-related attributes such as power consumption,
   energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network,
   its equipment, and the services that are provided over it and suggest
   a set of metrics that provide network observability and can be used
   to optimize a network's "greenness".  [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage]
   and [I-D.cprjgf-bmwg-powerbench] provide suggestions for measuring
   power usage of live networks under different traffic loads and
   various switch router configuration settings.
