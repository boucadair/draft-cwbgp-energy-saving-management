      <t>The IETF has specified YANG modules for energy efficiency Management,
e.g., Energy Saving Network models <xref target="I-D.cwbgp-green-energy-saving-management"/>,
Power Management Device Model <xref target="I-D.li-green-power"/>.
Other relevant YANG data models are Network topologies Base Model <xref target="RFC8345"/>
and Network Inventory Base Model <xref target="I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang"/>.
There are common data nodes and structures that
are present in all of these models or at least a subset of them.</t>
      <t>This document defines a common YANG module for energy efficiency metrics and
energy efficiency capabilities that is meant to be reused by various energy
efficiency-related modules such as energy saving Network models, energy saving
network inventory model and energy saving device models.</t>
      <t>The "ietf-energy-efficiency-common" module includes a set of identities, types, and
groupings for energy efficiency metrics and energy efficiency capabilities that are
meant to be reused by other energy efficiency-related YANG modules independently of
their characteristics (e.g., variable, invariable) and the type of the module
(e.g., network model, device model), including possible future revisions of existing
models (e.g., the Network Topology <xref target="RFC8345"/> or the Network Inventory
<xref target="I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang"/>).</t>

 service boards reside. According to the current temperature and target
 temperature of each board, the system implements stepless speed adjustment in
 different zones.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>"unused-high-speed-interface-shutdown": When detecting an unused high-speed
interface, the system shuts down the interface to reduce power consumption
of the interface circuits. When the interface needs to run service, the
system will automatically wake up the interface and restore the interface
to the normal working state.</t>

            <li>
              <t>"dynamic-frequency-adjustment": When detecting that a service board is carrying a small
 service load, the system automatically reduces the working frequency of the
 service processing module of the board while maintaining the service
 quality. In doing so, power consumption of the service processing module
 is reduced. When the service load of the board increases, the system
 automatically increases the working frequency of the service processing
 module to meet service needs.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>"unused-channel-shutdown": When an unused channel is detected, the unused
channel is closed. Dynamically open the channel when detecting that there
are services on the channel.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>"load-based-power-module-scheduling": Power modules intelligently schedule
internal power supply based on the power load. When the power load decreases,
some power supplies are automatically disabled. When the power load increases,
the disabled power supplies are enabled again.</t>
            </li>
            <li>
              <t>"load-based-board-scheduling": Boards intelligently schedule internal forwarding resources
 based on the service load. When the service load decreases,
 some forwarding resources are automatically disabled or the
 working frequency of the forwarding resources is reduced.
 When the service load increases, the disabled forwarding
 resources are enabled again or the working frequency of
 forwarding resources is improved. In the case of burst
 traffic, packet forwarding may be delayed, but packets
 will not be lost.</t>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

      <t>This section is modeled after the template described in <xref section="3.7" sectionFormat="of" target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis"/>.</t>
      <t>The "ietf-energy-efficiency-common" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>. These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref target="RFC4252"/>, TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and
   QUIC <xref target="RFC9000"/>) and have to use mutual authentication.</t>
      <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/>
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.</t>
      <t>The YANG module defines a set of identities, types, and
   groupings. These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG
   modules. The module by itself does not expose any data nodes that
   are writable, data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.
   As such, there are no additional security issues related to
   the YANG module that need to be considered.</t>
      <t>Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.</t>

              <t>YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and notifications for network management protocols. This document describes the syntax and semantics of version 1.1 of the YANG language. YANG version 1.1 is a maintenance release of the YANG language, addressing ambiguities and defects in the original specification. There are a small number of backward incompatibilities from YANG version 1. This document also specifies the YANG mappings to the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF).</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>   Network sustainability is a key issue facing the industry.  Networks
   consume significant amounts of power at a time when the cost of power
   is rising and sensitivity about sustainability is very high.  As an
   industry, we need to find ways to optimize the power efficiency of
   our networks both at a micro and macro level.  We have observed that
   traffic levels fluctuate and when traffic ebbs there is much more
   capacity than is needed.  Powering off portions of network elements
   could save a significant amount of power, but to scale and be
   practical, this must be automated.

   The natural mechanism for enabling automation would be a Yet Another
   Next Generation (YANG) interface, so this document proposes a YANG
   model for power management.

   required to control (and thus optimize) the energy use of involved
   network element and their components.

   This document is defines a set of key terms used within the IETF when
   discussing energy efficiency in network management.  Such reference
   document helps framing discussion and agreeing upon a set of main
   concepts in this area.

              <t>   With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever
   increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of network devices.
   Operators are begining to seek more information of power consumption
   in the network, have no standard mechanism to measure, report and
   compare power usage of different networking equipment under different
   network configuration and conditions.

   This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live
   networks under different traffic loads and various switch router
   configuration settings.  It provides a benchmarking suite which can
   be employed for any networking device .
