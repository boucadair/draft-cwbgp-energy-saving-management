     A Network Topology Data Model for Energy Efficiency Management
     draft-cwbgp-green-topology-energy-efficiency-management-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG Network Topology Data Model that can be
   used for Energy Efficiency Management within a network.  The model
   provides both network-centric view of energy consumption of network
   devices and device view of energy consumption of individual
   components within network devices.

1.  Introduction

   With the growth of networks and the increase of awareness about the
   environmental impact, it is important to ensure energy efficiency in
   the operation of network infrastructures.  Operators are thus seeking
   for more information to reflect the power consumption of a network
   and the contribution of involved nodes.

   However, there are no standard mechanisms to report and control
   dynamic power usage or energy consumption of different networking
   equipment under different network configuration and conditions.  For
   example, in a 'Tidal network' in which traffic volume undergoes
   significant fluctuations at different times, various energy
   management methods might be envisaged to optimize the energy
   efficiency at the network scale, e.g., by selectively disabling ports
   or cards on specific network nodes based on (forecast) traffic
   patterns.

   This document defines YANG modules for use in energy management
   within a network.  The modules cover both network and device levels
   (Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]).  The modules can be
   used, e.g., for monitoring the energy consumption of network devices,
   such as (but are not limited to) routers, switches, security
   gateways, hosts, or servers.  Where applicable, device monitoring
   extends to the individual components of the device.

   The network model augments the "ietf-network" module [RFC8345], with
   the following rationale:

   *  Required parameters to monitor, control, and adjust nodes and
      components behaviors are added to the network topology as this
      allows operator to better assess the implications on node-specific
      action on the overall network.

   The document leverages types defined in [RFC3418] and [RFC6933].

4.  Energy Saving Management Data Model Overview

4.1.  Overview

   "ietf-ntw-energy-saving" augments the node of abstract network model
   defined in [RFC8345] with energy consumption and power usage related
   attributes.  At the network element level, the data model covers
   configuration of the energy saving mode and a set of related
   parameters to manage (e.g., retrieve or adjust) the status of power
   units, fans, boards, cards, ports, processors, and links.  For
   example, the adjustment methods include frequency tuning, shutdown,
   or sleep mode.  In addition, the methods also support the energy
   saving configuration for the 'tidal' traffic flow, where related
   components can be turned off, e.g., during "idle" hours to optimize
   the energy consumption and then woken up based on some triggered
   (e.g., busy hours or other scheduled events).

   The data model defines energy saving modes representing some energy
   consumption levels, which are basic, standard, or deep.  For each
   consumption level, there is a combination of methods to reach the
   energy saving target level.

   At the component level, the data model includes a set of monitoring
   statistics for energy consumption and energy saving operational state
   of each component within the network device.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-ntw-energy-saving" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
   QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are several data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Specifically, the following subtrees
   and data nodes have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   energy-saving-modes:  This leaf specifies the energy saving mode set
      globally on a device.

   esm-ntw:energy-saving/esm-ntw:enabled:  This leaf enable/disables
      energy saving state of specific component.

      Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be
      considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-
      config, or notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the
      following subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
      vulnerabilities:

      'TBC':  ....

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  The "IETF XML" Registry

   This document requests IANA to register the following URIs in the

      XML: N/A, the requested URIs are XML namespaces.

7.2.  The "YANG Module Names" Registry

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG modules in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry group.

Acknowledgments

   This work has benefited from the discussions that occurred during the
   Sustainable Networking Side Meeting in IETF#117 and the "e-impact"
   IAB workshop.  In particular, [I-D.cx-opsawg-green-metrics] assess
   several sustainability-related attributes such as power consumption,
   energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network,
   its equipment, and the services that are provided over it and suggest
   a set of metrics that provide network observability and can be used
   to optimize a network's "greenness".  [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage]
   and [I-D.cprjgf-bmwg-powerbench] provide suggestions for measuring
   power usage of live networks under different traffic loads and
   various switch router configuration settings.
