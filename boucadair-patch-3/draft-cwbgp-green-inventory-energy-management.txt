    A Network Inventory Data Model for Energy Efficiency Management
          draft-cwbgp-green-inventory-energy-management-latest

Abstract

   As a complement to the YANG Network Topology Data Model for Energy
   Efficiency Management, which is used for monitoring the dynamic
   energy consumption of network devices, this document defines YANG
   Network Inventory Data Model for Energy Efficiency Management that
   can be used for maintaining capability related energy efficiency
   attributes.  The model provides both network view and device view of
   energy efficiency related inventory information.

1.  Introduction

   With the growth of networks and the increase of awareness about the
   environmental impact, it is important to ensure energy efficiency in
   the operation of network infrastructures.  Operators are thus seeking
   for more information to reflect the power consumption of a network
   and the contribution of involved nodes.

   However, there are no standard mechanisms to report either capability
   related energy efficiency attributes or dynamic power consumption of
   different networking equipment under different network configuration
   and conditions.  [I-D.cwbgp-green-energy-saving-management] defines
   YANG module which is used for monitoring the dynamic energy
   consumption of network devices at both network and device levels
   (Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]).

   As a complement to the YANG Network Topology Data Model for Energy
   Efficiency Management [I-D.cwbgp-green-energy-saving-management],
   this document defines YANG Network Inventory Data Model for Energy
   Efficiency Management that can be used for maintaining capability
   related energy efficiency attributes.  The model provides both
   network view and device view of energy efficiency related inventory
   information.

   The inventory model augments the "ietf-network-inventory" module
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] with the following rationale:

   *  Parameters that reflect the saving modes and methods are
      considered as capabilities, and are thus maintained in the
      inventory.

   The document leverages types defined in [RFC3418] and [RFC6933].

4.  Energy Saving Management Data Model Overview

4.1.  Overview

   As described in [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang], the Network
   Inventory YANG data model is used to maintain the base network
   inventory information.  This document defines the YANG module "ietf-
   ni-energy-saving", which augments network element of the network
   Inventory base model with energy saving modes, associated energy
   saving methods and augments the component of the network inventory
   base model with capability related power attributes.

   The data model defines energy saving modes representing some energy
   consumption levels, which are basic, standard, or deep.  For each
   consumption level, there is a combination of methods to reach the
   energy saving target level.

   At the component level, the data model includes a set of threshold
   related power parameters such as rated power, expected volts.

4.2.  ESM Inventory Model

   The structure of the ESM Network Inventory Model is depicted in
   Figure 1.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-ni-energy-saving" YANG module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to
   use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and
   QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   'TBC':  ....

7.  IANA Considerations

      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URIs are XML namespaces.

7.2.  The "YANG Module Names" Registry

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG modules in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry group.

Acknowledgments

   This work has benefited from the discussions that occurred during the
   Sustainable Networking Side Meeting in IETF#117 and the "e-impact"
   IAB workshop.  In particular, [I-D.cx-opsawg-green-metrics] assess
   several sustainability-related attributes such as power consumption,
   energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network,
   its equipment, and the services that are provided over it and suggest
   a set of metrics that provide network observability and can be used
   to optimize a network's "greenness".  [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage]
   and [I-D.cprjgf-bmwg-powerbench] provide suggestions for measuring
   power usage of live networks under different traffic loads and
   various switch router configuration settings.
