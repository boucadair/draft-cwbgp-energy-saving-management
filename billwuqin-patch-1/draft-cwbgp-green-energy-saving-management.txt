1.  Introduction

   With the growth of networks and the increase of awareness about the
   environmental impact, it is important to ensure energy efficiency in
   the operation of network infrastructures.  Operators are thus seeking
   for more information to reflect the power consumption of a network
   and the contribution of involved nodes.

   However, there are no standard mechanisms to report and control power
   usage or energy consumption of different networking equipment under
   different network configuration and conditions.  For example, in
   'tidal network' in which traffic volume undergoes significant
   fluctuations at different times, various energy management methods
   might be envisaged to optimize the energy efficiency at the network
   scale, e.g., by selectively disabling ports or cards on specific
   network nodes based on (forecast) traffic patterns.

   This document defines YANG modules for use in energy management
   within a newtork.  The modules covers both network and device levels
   (Section 3.5.1 of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis]).  The modules can be
   used, e.g., for monitoring the energy consumption of network devices,
   such as (but are not limited to) routers, switches, security
   gateways, hosts, or servers.  Where applicable, device monitoring
   extends to the individual components of the device.

   The network model augments the "ietf-network" module [RFC8345], while
   the inventory model augments the "ietf-network-inventory" module
   [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang] with the following rationale:

   *  Parameters that reflect the saving modes and methods are
      considered as capabilities, and are thus maintained in the
      inventory.

   *  Required parameters to monitor, control and adjust nodes and
      components behaviors are added to the network topology as this
      allows operator to better assess the implications on node-specific
      action on the overall network.

   The document leverages types defined in [RFC3418] and [RFC6933].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The meanings of the symbols in the YANG tree diagrams are defined in
   [RFC8340].

   The following terms are used in the document:

   Network Inventory:  A collection of data for network devices and
      their components managed by a specific management system
      [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].

   Chassis:  A physical container that allows installation of power
      modules, fan modules, and various types of boards and cards
      [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].

   Network Element:  A manageable network entity that contains hardware
      and software units, e.g., a network device installed on one or
      several chassis [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].

   Board and Card:  A pluggable equipment can be inserted into one or
      several slots/ sub-slots and can afford a specific transmission
      function independently [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].  The
      core modular units for processing data.  Depending on functions,
      they can be classified into Main Processing Unit (MPU), Switch
      Fabric Unit (SFU), Line Processing Unit (LPU), and other types.
      MPU is responsible for system control, management, and monitoring.
      SFU is responsible for line-rate data switching on the data plane.
      LPU is responsible for data packet processing and traffic
      management.

   Port and Interface:  A port is a physical entity that is used for
      connections.  While an interface is a logical entity for
      connections.

3.  YANG Prefixes

   Names of data nodes and other data model objects are prefixed using
   the standard prefix associated with the corresponding YANG imported
   modules, as shown in Table 1.

4.  Energy Saving Management Data Model Overview

4.1.  Overview

   As described in [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang], the Network
   Inventory YANG data model is used to maintain the base network
   inventory information.  This document defines the YANG module "ietf-
   ni-energy-saving", which augments network element of the network
   Inventory base model with energy saving modes, associated energy
   saving methods and augments the component of the network inventory
   base model with capability related power attributes.

   "ietf-ntw-energy-saving" augments the node of asbstract network model
   defined in [RFC8345] with energy consumption and power usage related
   attributes.  At the network element level, the data model covers
   configuration of the energy saving mode and a set of related
   parameters to manage (e.g., retrieve or adjust) the status of power
   units, fans, boards, cards, ports, processors, and links.  For
   example, the adjustment methods include frequency tuning, shutdown,
   or sleep mode.  In addition, the methods also support the energy
   saving configuration for the 'tidal' traffic flow, where related
   components can be turned off, e.g., during "idle" hours to optimize
   the energy consumption and then woken up based on some triggered
   (e.g., busy hours or other scheduled events).

   The data model defines energy saving modes representing some energy
   consumption levels, which are basic, standard, or deep.  For each
   consumption level, there is a combination of methods to reach the
   energy saving target level.

   At the component level, the data model includes a set of monitoring
   statistics for energy consumption and energy saving operational state
   of each component within the network device.  It also includes
   threshold related power parameters such as rated power, expected
   volts.

   In order to ease reuse of various paramters independent of the module
   layer, this document also defines a common model: "ietf-energy-
   saving-common".

   The structure of each module is provided in the following
   subsections.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section uses the template described in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocol such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].These network management
   protocols are required to use a secure transport layer and mutual
   authentication, e.g., SSH [RFC6242] without the "none" authentication
   option, Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8446] with mutual X.509
   authentication, and HTTPS with HTTP authentication (Section 11 of
   [RFC9110]).

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are several data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Specifically, the following subtrees
   and data nodes have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   energy-saving-modes:  This leaf specifies the energy saving mode set
      globally on a device.

   esm-ntw:energy-saving/esm-ntw:enabled:  This leaf enable/disables
      energy saving state of specific component.

      Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be
      considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
      It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-
      config, or notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the
      following subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
      vulnerabilities:

      'TBC':  ....

Acknowledgments

   This work has benefited from the discussions that occured during the
   Sustainable Networking Side Meeting in IETF#117 and the "e-impact"
   IAB workshop.  In particular, [I-D.cx-opsawg-green-metrics] assess
   several sustainability-related attributes such as power consumption,
   energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network,
   its equipment, and the services that are provided over it and suggest
   a set of metrics that provide network observability and can be used
   to optimize a network's "greenness".  [I-D.manral-bmwg-power-usage]
   provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live networks under
   different traffic loads and various switch router configuration
   settings.
